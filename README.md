AMOS-SS14-Group-3
=================

This is the AMOS Summer Term 2014 project of Team 3.

It is our goal to provide an Open Source Management Dashboard for our client in a Windows 8 Store App.
For documentation, have a look at the source code or the planning documents.

We hope to learn from this project about Agile Methods and Open Source.
